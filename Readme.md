TODO: Simple outline of a ASP.NET WebAPI solution

## Need Help
If you have some knowledge of generics, I could use help.

I have a repository layer (NorthwindWebAPI.Data) that contains CRUD classes for Customers, Employees & Orders.

Naturally the code within these is very similar and I could use suggestions or sample code showing how I could implement a base class that handles the common code in Get, Add, Update and Delete methods.
